## üìã Requirements

* SFTP server to connect to. üåê
* VS Code 1.95.0 or higher; if you need support for an earlier version, please open a request through GitHub. üì•üêô

## ‚öôÔ∏è Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

### üõ†Ô∏è Behavior
* `sftpfs.behavior.notification.upload.fileSize`: (Upload): Display a progress notification when a file exceeds the specified size in kilobytes, making it easy to track the current upload progress.
* `sftpfs.behavior.notification.download.fileSize`: (Download): Display a progress notification when a file exceeds the specified size in kilobytes, making it easy to track the current upload progress.

### ü¶ä Pool configuration

> The app uses two types of pools: a **passive** pool and a **heavy** pool.
> 
> The **passive** pool is intended for low-cost operations like listing directories, opening files, renaming folders/files, etc. Lower values are recommended for this pool.
> 
> The **heavy** pool, in contrast, is used for high-cost operations such as downloading or uploading large quantities of files. Set higher values for this pool, depending on the limitations of your SFTP server, as some servers restrict the number of simultaneous connections a user can open.

The following configurations apply to both types of pools. Replace `<type>` with the appropriate pool type: `passive` or `heavy`.

* `sftpfs.pool.<type>.max`: The maximum number of connections to open simultaneously. Keep in mind that the SFTP server may limit the total number of concurrent connections.
* `sftpfs.pool.<type>.min`: The minimum number of connections to keep in the pool for future requests. For optimal performance, it's recommended to set this to at least 1/3 of the maximum connections. For example, if the maximum connections are set to 15, set this value to 5.
* `sftpfs.pool.<type>.minIdle`: The number of connections to keep idle. A connection is marked as idle after being released following an SFTP operation, allowing it to be reused for subsequent operations without the need to reopen the connection.
* `sftpfs.pool.<type>.maxQueue`: The maximum number of requests to keep in the queue when all connections are in use. We recommend setting this value as high as possible, for example, 1,000,000, as the extension performs many operations in parallel. This means multiple acquire requests are queued simultaneously to execute the operations.
* `sftpfs.pool.<type>.idleTimeoutMillis`: The time, in milliseconds, to keep a connection idle. Idle connections will be closed if they are not used after the specified timeout is reached.

### üõú Remote configuration

There are two ways to add a remote configuration to the extension:

1. Use the command "SFTP FS: Add remote..." (CTRL + SHIFT + P on Windows)
2. Edit the configuration directly.

For option #2, open your `settings.json` file and add the following configuration:

```
"sftpfs.remotes": {
  "YourNameForThisRemote": {
    "host": "YourSFTPHost",
    "port": 22,
    "username": "YourSFTPUsername",
    "password": "YourSFTPPassword",
    "remotePath": "/"
  },
  ...
  ...
  ... // Add as many as you need
},
```

### üß© Working Directories

The `sftpfs.workDirs` configuration is automatically updated by the extension when you select a folder to synchronize remote files with your local storage.

However, you can adjust the configuration through the settings.json file by modifying the following configuration block:

```
"sftpfs.workDirs": {
  "RemoteName": {
    "workDir": "/C:/MyPath/For/Local/Folder"
  }
},
```

## ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• Known Issues

* Editing files locally (e.g., via the operating system's file explorer) will not be immediately reflected in the VS Code file explorer. I am currently working on an update to implement this feature.

## üìã Release Notes
